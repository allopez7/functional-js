# Functional JavaScript

## Install & Setup

For this project, I am using the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) testing framework to test the functions.
<br />
So, you need to install it using either [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
<br />
<br />
Run one of the following commands in your project's root directory:

```bash
yarn
```
-or-

```bash
npm i
```

## Instructions

First, follow the `Install & Setup` section. Once setup, it is time to start.
<br />
Each function is set and named, but all functions are empty functions. Some of them will take params, return values,
<br />
and may have layers. These empty functions are just placeholers. Don't be afraid to change them. The names, however,
<br />
are required as those are the functions the test file is trying to import to test your code.
<br />
<br />
Each function has a comment above it with a description of the problem. If you don't understand what the question is
<br />
asking, it might help to look at what the test is doing. (I don't recommend this if you don't already know testing
<br />
frameworks in javascript!)
<br />
<br />
I recommend that you start by implementing the `identity` function, as it is the easiest and will be an easy way to
<br />
test your environment is setup correctly.
<br />
<br />
As a final note, this may seem trivial at first, but it will quickly ramp up and test your knowledge of JavaScript and
<br />
some of the key concepts of the language
<br />
<br />
Good luck! :)

## Testing

At the point that you are ready to test, it is as simple as running:

```bash
yarn test
```
-or-

```bash
npm test
```

This will start the Jest test runner and watch for changes to your code, triggering
<br />
a retest if it detects any changes.
